# DSD

My implementation of the Diffusion State Distance core function. 

DSD/calculator.py: can be used as a stand-alone via code or can replace the calculator function in the calcDSD.py file of the original DSD package located at http://dsd.cs.tufts.edu/.

myDSD/dsdcore.py: the same, can be used as a stand-alone via code or can replace the dsdcore.py file in the original cDSD package located at http://dsd.cs.tufts.edu/.
